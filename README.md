# CryptoKid Coin Metadata

Repository for managing coin metadata for CryptoKid.

CryptoKid aims to provide a bit of descriptive information about the different currencies it supports. This repository is where this metadata is managed. We keep one `<coin>.json` file for each coin containing a `description`, `color`, a `url`, etc.

Users of the app, and anyone else interested, can submit a [pull request]() adding a coin they would like to see decorated with some metadata.
